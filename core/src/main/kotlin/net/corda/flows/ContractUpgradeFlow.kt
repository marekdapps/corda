/**
 * A flow to be used for upgrading state objects of an old contract to a new contract.
 *
 * The [Instigator] assembles the transaction for contract upgrade and sends out change proposals to all participants
 * ([Acceptor]) of that state. If participants agree to the proposed change, they each sign the transaction.
 * Finally, [Instigator] sends the transaction containing all signatures back to each participant so they can record it and
 * use the new updated state for future transactions.
